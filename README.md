# 📘 Common Intents Used in MessengerApp

## 🧩 1. Intent.ACTION_SEND

### 📝 Purpose

Used to send data (such as text, images, or files) from your app to another app that can handle that data type - e.g., Messages, Gmail, Facebook, etc.

### ⚙️ How It Works

- Creates an implicit intent that shares content with other apps.
- Android automatically shows a **chooser dialog** for the user to pick the target app.

### 💡 Example Used

```java
Intent sendIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
sendIntent.setType("text/plain");
sendIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, msg);
startActivity(Intent.createChooser(sendIntent, "Sharing..."));
```

### 🚀 Key Characteristics

| Type             | Implicit Intent                |
| Data type        | text/plain, image/\*, etc.     |

## 🖼️ 2. Intent.ACTION_PICK

### 📝 Purpose

Allows the user to pick an existing item from another app (usually from the **Gallery**, **Files**, or **Contacts**).

### ⚙️ How It Works

- Opens a system picker to let the user select a specific type of content (like an image).
- Returns a **URI** pointing to the selected item.

### 💡 Example Used

```java
Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_PICK, MediaStore.Images.Media.EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI);
pickImageLauncher.launch(intent);
```

### 🚀 Key Characteristics

| Data type        | image/\* (via MediaStore URI)          |
| User Interaction | Requires user selection                |
| Result           | Returns content URI via ActivityResult |

### ✅ Strengths

## 📸 3. MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE

### 📝 Purpose

- Returns a **Bitmap** (low-resolution preview) via extras.
- Can be configured to save the full-size image via a file URI.

### 💡 Example Used

```java
Intent intent = new Intent(MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE);
captureImageLauncher.launch(intent);
```

### 🚀 Key Characteristics

| Feature          | Description                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Type             | Implicit Intent                     |
| Data type        | Captured image (as Bitmap)          |
| User Interaction | Requires user to take a picture     |
| Result           | Returns image data in Intent extras |

### ✅ Strengths

- Integrates with system camera easily.
- No need to manually manage permissions for camera apps.
- Works consistently across Android devices.

## 🖼️ 4. Intent.ACTION_VIEW

### 📝 Purpose

Opens a piece of content (image, video, link, etc.) in another appropriate app.

### ⚙️ How It Works

- Uses the URI of a resource and opens it using any compatible app.
- Android determines the best app based on the content type (MIME type).

### 💡 Example Used

```java
Intent viewIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);
viewIntent.setDataAndType(uri, "image/*");
startActivity(viewIntent);
```

### 🚀 Key Characteristics

| Feature          | Description                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Type             | Implicit Intent                               |
| Data type        | Depends on file type (e.g., image/_, video/_) |
| User Interaction | Optional (opens directly)                     |
| Result           | Opens content in external app                 |

### ✅ Strengths

- Opens content in the most appropriate external app.
- Simple to use, no need to build custom viewers.
- Can handle many data types.
